# roll_a_dice_app

A new Flutter project.

NOTE: You have to have flutter and Android Studio installed in you PC to run this code.
Once the whole flutter is setup you have to open a virtual device from android studio and then run the main.dart file in the lib folder to finally access the application.  

This is my first flutter project which acts as a basic dice rolling app.I learned how to propely use gradient and used it to make the background look pretty. A button is provided to roll the dice on the screen which randomly generates any one face out of the 6 face images we have given in the folder and displays it to the user. As this is my first project I haven't added any special animation for the rolling of the dice.

Some snapshots of the app:
